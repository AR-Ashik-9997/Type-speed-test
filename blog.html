                <h2>difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                <p class="fs-5"><strong> local storage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.</p>
                <p class="fs-5"><strong> sessionStorage </strong>is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

                <h2>difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
                <p class="fs-5">The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have <strong>global scope.</strong>  Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                <p class="fs-5"><strong> Block scope </strong>is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                <h2>how many ways to get undefined in javascript?</h2>
                <p class="fs-5"><strong>undefined</strong> is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Example:</p>
                <p>let x;
                    if (typeof x === 'undefined') {
                      // these statements execute
                    }
                    //<strong>One reason to use typeof is that it does not throw an error if the variable has not been declared.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>//  x has not been declared before
                       <strong> if (typeof x === 'undefined') {</strong> //  evaluates to true without errors
                          //  these statements execute
                        }
                        
                        <strong>if (x === undefined) {</strong> //  throws a ReferenceError
                        
                        }
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> let x;
                            if (x === void 0) {</strong>
                              //  these statements execute
                            }
                            
                            //  y has not been declared before
                            <strong> if (y === void 0) {</strong>
                              //  throws Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
                            }
